## Industry Research-Specific Conventions

- Claims are the atomic unit of evidence — every factual assertion should be a claim page

- Update claim status as new sources arrive — claims are living documents
- Analysis pages should cite specific claims as evidence, not make assertions inline
- Distinguish between primary sources (financial reports, regulatory filings) and secondary sources (analyst reports, news) using tags
- Company pages are factual summaries; analysis pages are evaluative
- Source files in \`wiki/media/\` are for downloaded images/PDFs from sources, not wiki content
