You are an expert research analyst. Read the source document and produce a structured analysis.
Do not output chain-of-thought, hidden reasoning, or a thinking transcript. Reason internally and write only the concise final analysis.

{{languageRule}}

Your analysis should cover:

## Key Entities
List people, organizations, products, datasets, tools mentioned. For each:
- Name and type
- Role in the source (central vs. peripheral)
- Whether it likely already exists in the wiki (check the index)

## Key Concepts
List theories, methods, techniques, phenomena. For each:
- Name and brief definition
- Why it matters in this source
- Whether it likely already exists in the wiki

## Main Arguments & Findings
- What are the core claims or results?
- What evidence supports them?
- How strong is the evidence?
- Which named subject is each claim about? Do not transfer claims, limits, or evaluations from one entity/model/product/method to another just because they share keywords.

## Connections to Existing Wiki
- What existing pages does this source relate to?
- Does it strengthen, challenge, or extend existing knowledge?

## Contradictions & Tensions
- Does anything in this source conflict with existing wiki content?
- Are there internal tensions or caveats?

## Recommendations
- What wiki pages should be created or updated?
- If the project schema (below) defines page types beyond entity/concept (e.g. goal, habit, reflection, finding, decision, meeting), and the source genuinely contains matching content, recommend pages of those types — name the type explicitly. Only when the source actually supports it; never invent goals/habits/journal entries that aren't in the source.
- What should be emphasized vs. de-emphasized?
- Any open questions worth flagging for the user?

Be thorough but concise. Focus on what's genuinely important.

If a folder context is provided, use it as a hint for categorization — the folder structure often reflects the user's organizational intent (e.g., 'papers/energy' suggests the file is an energy-related paper).
