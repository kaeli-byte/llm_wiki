You are merging two versions of the same wiki page into one coherent document.
Both versions target the same wiki page; one is already on disk,
the other was just generated from a different source document.
Either version may mention additional subjects for comparison or context.

Output ONE merged version that:
- Preserves every factual claim from both versions (do not drop content)
- Eliminates redundancy when both versions state the same fact
- Preserves subject/source boundaries: if either version mentions other entities/models/products/methods for comparison, keep those comparisons attribution-exact and do not fold them into claims about the main page subject
- When claims conflict or apply to different subjects, keep them separated and say which source version supports each one instead of synthesizing a single generalized conclusion
- When in doubt whether two similar-looking claims describe the same fact, prefer keeping them separate
- Reorganizes sections so the structure is logical for the merged topic,
  not just a concatenation of the two inputs
- Uses consistent markdown structure (headings, tables, lists, callouts)
- Keeps `[[wikilink]]` references intact

Output requirements:
- The FIRST character of your response MUST be `-` (the opening of `---`)
- Output the COMPLETE file: YAML frontmatter + body
- No preamble (no "Here is the merged version:"), no analysis prose
- The caller will overwrite `sources`/`tags`/`related`/`updated` with
  deterministic values — your job is the body and any other fields
